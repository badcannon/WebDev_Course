Git hub is used to host our files for this course ! 

Git hub configs 
-> Create a new repo
-> Create a index page 
-> clone it on your machine ! 
-> create a sub folder and create a index page in Gh-Pages branch not on master 

Git commands : 1 > to clone we use  /* git clone <Link> */
               2 > to check on which branch we are on we use git status /* git status */
               3 > to change branch we use /* git checkout <branchName> */
               4 > make a new sub directory in the branch using mkdir command 
               5 > To mark to commit any changes  to the git use the command /* git add <whatever file you want to add  or ( . )for all > */
               6 > To commit changes we use /* git commit -m "Message goes  here "*/
               7 > to push the committed changes use /*git push */
               8 > to pull any changes made by other to your local machine we use /*git pull */
               9 > to merge we just push after pulling 
              10 > to delete a branch locally we use /*git branch -d <name>*/
              11 > to delete the remote branch we use /* git push <ref ex : origin > --delete  branch  */




Html basics : 
 they have an opening and closing tag and they enclose something  ex : <p></p>
 tag p and element p are one at the same 
 <p> is opening tag </p> closing tag 
 <br/> has no closing tag 
 attribute is a name-value pair which contain meta data about the element itself 
  ex : <p id="myId"></p> 

  rules : no space after the opening angular bracket 
          no space after the closing angular bracket   
          space must be given after tag name for different attributes 
          attributes can only be given in the opening tag 
          attribute id must be unique for every element or tag
          
    Block and  inline elements in html4 in htm5 its flow and phrasing content 
    respectively ! 

    Block here has its own line and inline will just sit in where ever it is asked to 
    block will have a new line to begin with and to end with 

    block level elements such as <div> can contain inline elements
        where as the inline elements can only contain other inline elements 
        
    block level renders on a new line where as inline elements render on the same line !
     
semantic html elements implies some meaning to the content 
it may help seo (search engine optimization )

semantic tags: 
 heading : 
       <h1> -- > <h6> 
    most import to least important 
    this only used to structure the html page 
    
    
    Header tag <header>
         contains some information  link the logo of the company or  some tag line 
         etc sometimes navigation too 
    nav tag 
          it contains navigation or links to other pages or parts of the website 
     
    section tags :
    defines a section 
    article tag 
    defines an article within a section 
                                        //the article might have sections too no hard and fast rule //
 
    aside tag  
    this tag has some information about the main topic of the page but its not direct 
    its related 
   footer tag 
   has footer information 

   all of these are block level tags 

   lists : 
 html lists : there are structures that allow similar items 
 they are organizational tool 
 <ul> tag : 
     is an unordered list 
 <li> tag is within the ul/ol tags which means list items 
 
 <ol> tag : ordered list li stays the same 


    Character Entity references : 
    
To escape character 
  < - > &lt; 
  > -> &gt; 
  & -> &amp;
  copyright - > &copy;
  Non breaking space - > &nbsp; (This is used where we want to warp a sentence completely when the browser size changes )
  " Quotes" -> &quot; 

links : 
    different types of links : 
    internal links : href attribute is Hypertext reference value of this can be a relative or absolute 
                    title attribute is used to help the visually impaired people 
     a tag is anchor tag and its both a flow content and a phrasing element (block and inline ) 
     Cuz it can house a <div> tag and can also be part of a <div> tag ! 
     
     //it opens up in the same window 

     external links  : their href value is usually a https or http link like going to a different website 
                      
     target attribute can be used to target the opening of the website in a new window with the value _blank 

fragment identifier : # sign is used to achieve fragment identifier 
                      its used to jump to different part of the webpage 
                      also used for single page application 
                      
              there are 2 ways to achieve this 

          1> define anchor tag as follows : 
          <a href= "#section1" > section 1 </a>

          and then 

          <section name="section1" >Stuff...  </section>

          2> define an anchor tag 
          <a href = "#top">Top</a>
          
          <a name= "top"></a>
can be done ;
implemented in HtmlBasics learning thingy

including images : 

<img > tag is used to place images in the document 
attributes : 
        src : source of the image can be relative or absolute path 
       height  : height in pixels or percentage 
       width  : width in pixels or percentages 
       alt : is used by screen reader 

img tag is a inline tag 
width and height are defined to reserve space for the image 
we can use the developers tools to throttle the network to check the same !

CSS : -> Cascading style sheets 
         Css is used to style the sheets and it is governed by the html rules 
         thereby creating a perfect match 
    
    Anatomy of Css Rule : 
                        p {
                            color : blue;
                        }
            Here p : is the selector and here all the paragraph elements will be affected 
                 and then its followed by curly braces 
                 then we have declaration 
                 where we have a property and a value 
                 property being a set predefined by css 
                 values are set amount which are associated with each of the property 

            they have colon in b/w and a semicolon to end 
        
            Eg : p{
                 color:blue ;
                 font-size :20px;
                 width : 200px;

            } 
            Here the width means it p must be within 200 px 
   set of css rules is called a style sheet 

Every browser Comes with a default css style by the browser !
