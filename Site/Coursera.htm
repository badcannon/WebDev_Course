Html basics : 
 they have an opening and closing tag and they enclose something  ex : <p></p>
 tag p and element p are one at the same 
 <p> is opening tag </p> closing tag 
 <br/> has no closing tag 
 attribute is a name-value pair which contian meta data about the element itself 
  ex : <p id="myId"></p> 

  rules : no space after the opening angular bracket 
          no space after the closing angular bracket   
          space must be given after tag name for different attributes 
          attributes can only be given in the opening tag 
          attribute id must be unique for every element or tag
          
    Block and  inline elements in html4 in htm5 its flow and pharasing content 
    respectively ! 

    Block here has its own line and inline will just sit in where ever it is asked to 
    block will have a new line to begin with and to end with 

    block level elemets such as <div> can contian inline elements
        where as the inline elements can only contian other inline elements 
        
    block level renders on a new line where as inline elements render on the same line !
     
semantic html elements implies some meaning to the content 
it may help seo (search engine optimiztion )

semantic tags: 
 heading : 
       <h1> -- > <h6> 
    most import to least important 
    this only used to structure the html page 
    
    
    Header tag <header>
         contains some information  link the logo of the company or  some tag line 
         etc sometimes navigation too 
    nav tag 
          it contains navigation or links to other pages or parts of the website 
     
    section tags :
    difines a section 
    article tag 
    defines an article within a section 
                                        //the article might have sections too no hard and fast rule //
 
    aside tag  
    this tag has some information about the main topic of the page but its not direct 
    its related 
   footer tag

   all of these are block level tags 

   lists :

 they are orginaiztional tool 
 <ul> tag : 
     is an unorderd list 
 <li> tag is within the ul/ol tags which means list items 
 
 <ol> tag : ordered list li stays the same

To escape character 
  < - > &lt; 
  > -> &gt;
