header ! part ! :

<nav id="header-nav" class="navbar navbar-default">
                 <div class="container">
                     
                 </div>
    
we are going to create the nav bar in the header section of the page 
with the nav element 

we use the id = "header-nav" : 

and we will use 2 classes of the bootstrap with navbar and navbar-default 
which share properties with each other 

here the container is used to for the header and we dont want any padding and it is not nessacary for it to
stretch all the way to the browser ends 

Its obsolete
