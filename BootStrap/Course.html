    The Code is in the index page with comments everywhere Required ! 

    bootstrap grid system  : 
    This is the grid system code  : 
    <div class ="container ">  
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4">Col 1 </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    The grid must always be in side the container class or the container-fluid class
    container-fluid class streaches your layout to the full width and then gives consistent padding 
    regular contaier class gives regular break points 

    the row class gives horizontall groups of coloumns and apllies left and right margins 
    here negative margin is used to align the row with the regular content in the web page 
    that can be seen in a image here : https://ibb.co/gZBB8QN

    Every boot strap col class is like this : col-size-span 

    size is a screen width range identifier : eg : lg is min 1200px 
    span is how many columns therefore its 1 to 12 ! 
     
    we can also use nav too instead of div for the row !
    you can see the code used in Grid.html
